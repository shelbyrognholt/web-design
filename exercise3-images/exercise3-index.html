<h1>Hello World</h1>
<hr>
<h2>A place I would like to visit.</h2>
<p>If I could visit anywhere in the world, I would like to visit Thailand. Thailand is a beautiful country with so much
    diverse culture to experience. Thailand has everything from beautiful, tropical beaches, to culturally-rich cities.
    I also am a huge fan of Thai food, so that's definitely a plus as well.</p>

<h2> 1 person I admire <br> (Past or Present)</h2>
<p> One person i admire is Ellen Degeneres. Ellen came out to the world on national television during a time when being
    gay was not acceptable. At that time, so many people were closeted in Hollywood because they feared not being able
    to get work if they came out. She took that risk after growing tired of hiding such an important part of who she is.
    She did, in fact, face a lot of discrimination, her show was canceled, and she didn't get work for 3 years. Her
    bravery paved the way for so many LGBTQ+ people today, and I, for one, am very grateful-- for when I came out, I was
    able to have a much better experience, and it's because of people like her.</p>
